# Can It Recycle?
Can It Recycle? Empowers the Community to Recycle Through Awareness

We designed and programmed "Can it Recycle?" for HackDFW's Earthack 2016, my first hackathon. The application empowers the community to efficiently and effectively dispose of goods by analyzing the UPC barcode of products, receiving feedback regarding the information of the product, and sending feedback to the user about its disposal process and recyclability.
